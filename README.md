**CHALLENGE:**

Identify where to place EV charging stations across either the greater Dallas or Chicago metropolitan areas to have the largest impact on the community.

**CONTEXT:**

President Biden signed the bipartisan infrastructure bill in November 2021, including a $5 billion investment in self-administered grants for nationwide electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. Each state has seen the increasing importance of identifying an efficient and sustainable way to help identify the locations for new EV stations and optimally allocate the available funds. KPMG clients seek advise on how to identify where EV charging stations should be placed for maximum return on investment.

**APPROACH:**

Students will be guided to utilize open source software tools to curate public datasets identified by KPMG that comprise several socioeconomic, environmental and infrastructure variables. It is at the teamâ€™s discretion how to define and quantify impact, what AI technique is used, as well as what variables from the datasets provided are inputs in the model. At the end of the project, the team will provide an executive summary readout detailing the approach taken and proposed recommendations of where to build the EV charging stations. Students will walk away from this challenge understanding how data is at the core of addressing ESG issues for corporations and governments.

**DATASET DESCRIPTION:**

Students will be provided links to access dozens of publicly available data for Dallas and Chicago, comprised of several socioeconomic, environmental and infrastructure variables. The data made available to students to choose from includes structured and semi-structured datasets, including shapefiles of geographic features. In addition, KPMG will provide access to thought leadership pieces to provide students with a business understanding on the infrastructure bill and what Dallas and Chicago are each respectively doing to implement EV charging stations.
